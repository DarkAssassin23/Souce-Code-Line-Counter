# Souce Code Line Counter

About
-----------
- This is a customizable script which recursively counts every line of code you've written in a given directory
- It reads in a confguration file (fileTypes.txt) which contains all the file types for the source code files you'd like it to count

__________________________


Usage
----------
By default, the script executes in its current directory. However, you can pass in the directory you would like it to scan as a parameter
```bash
python3 countLinesOfCodeWritten.py
```
```bash
python3 countLinesOfCodeWritten.py /super/cool/project/source_code
```
